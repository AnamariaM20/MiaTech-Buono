        <p>A fashion week is a week-long fashion industry event where fashion designers, brands, or "houses" display their latest collections in runway fashion shows to buyers and the media which influences upcoming fashion trends for the current and approaching seasons</p>
        <p> The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the fashion capitals of the world—in chronological order, New York City, London, Milan, and Paris, or the "Big Four".[3] The foundations of fashion week began in Paris in the late 1800s before spreading to New York, Milan, and London in the 20th century. What began as marketing garments in public spaces like racetracks grew into highly publicized events in themselves.[4][5] In the 2000s, themes of sustainability began emerging at fashion weeks and grew popular across the next decade.[6]</p>

        W hat is Fashion Week and where did it come from?
        Fashion Week, FW - is one of the main events in the fashion world, in which designers, fashion houses and brands demonstrate new collections. It is fashion weeks that set the trends for the current and future seasons.
        It all started, oddly enough, in Paris, when marketers of different brands dressed women in their new outfits and sent them to public places. For visiting, the places of the greatest gathering of people were chosen - salons, hippodromes, parks.
        The first fashion show dates back to 1903 and was organized by the New York store Ehrich Brothers. Gradually, the trend for screenings grew throughout the country and abroad. The first fashion week was held in 1943 - it was held in New York. The main goal of that fashion week was to demonstrate an alternative to French clothes, because during the Second World War it was impossible to go to Paris.
        <p>
        Fashion weeks are divided into types:

        Big Four Fashion Weeks are the most significant, setting trends, Weeks, held 2 times a year - in autumn (usually in September) and spring in 4 cities - New York, London, Milan and Paris.
        <span class="inline">Haute Couture Fashion Weeks - haute couture shows, held by fashion houses that are part of the Paris Fashion Syndicate, are held 2 times a year - in January and July; </span>

        Other Fashion Weeks - held in different cities of the world at different times throughout the year, do not have a big impact on the fashion industry.
        <b>From DRESS Magazine:</b>

        <p class="hidden"> The only thing that remains unchanged is order. The series of Fashion Weeks always begins in New York and ends in Paris.
        At the shows of the "Big Four", designers demonstrate trends for the next season. That is, what we have seen since September 8 in New York is the spring-summer 2022 collection. Why is this being done? Famous designers set trends for the new season, which adopt mass production. To develop models of clothes, sew them and bring them to stores, you need time - just those six months that pass between the show and the beginning of the season.

            <p><img src="https://dress-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/8chanelofficial.jpg" height="400px" width="350px">Most often, brands and fashion houses are shown in their own country, that is, if the Fashion House is based in France, then it will show the collection in Paris. However, designers do not have a ban on "moving" - Chanel, for example, no one will prohibit visiting the fashion week in Milan. From DRESS Magazin:
            Haute Couture Week is an exhibition of haute couture organized by the Paris Fashion Syndicate. The name comes from the French haute couture - high sewing, that is, single pieces of clothing, sewn for the most part by hand.
            Only those fashion houses that are part of the Paris Fashion Syndicate – an association for the most authoritative, significant and successful fashion houses in France – can demonstrate couture outfits as part of Haute Couture Fashion Week. Foreign houses can also get into the Syndicate, but the requirements for them are higher. They are granted the status of corresponding members.</p>
